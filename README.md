# Clite

Lite clients for API services.

## Why?

Many of these clients already exist somewhere else. However, they are often
bloated with features (and dependencies) that are not needed. For this reason,
I decided to create a set of tiny clients that have very few or no dependencies
on other packages and that can be easily used both client or server side.
